Right click on a widget, select the `Promote to ...` of context menu.

Promoting a widget indicates that it should be replaced with the specified subclass, in our case the `qmaterialwidgets.OutlinedPushButton`.

You will be presented with a dialog to specify the custom widget class the placeholder widget will become.

The header file is the name of the Python module used to import the class, which is `qmaterialwidgets`. Specify `OutlinedPushButton` as the class name of the widget to replace it with.

Well, the widget is now promoted to fluent push button. But you wonâ€™t be able to see any changes within Qt Designer. Save the window as `mainwindow.ui` and compile it to python code, you will see that the `OutlinedPushButton` is imported from `qmaterialwidgets` package.
